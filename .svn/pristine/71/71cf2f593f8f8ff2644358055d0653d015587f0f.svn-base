                <h5>As I once was</h5>
                <p>
                    I studied mathematics in college at an age when I had an urge to be book-smart. The last few years
                    has seen that urge all but die out, as I joined the workforce as a code monkey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel it returning. In practice the code only needs to work correctly, but I have a desire
                    to write it in a way that makes it agile to change, decoupled, elastic, readable, and maintainable.
                    And instructive. And I want to be able to do this quickly and efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus I have somehow gotten it in my head that I must review some core CS, namely the topics of
                    data structures and algorithms.
                </p>

                <h5>Maker of Websites</h5>
                <p>
                    I made a personal website, because as, ostensibly, a professional <em>web site maker</em>, I
                    really ought to have had one the whole time, I suppose.
                    I got really sidetracked making a baseball game in javascript. I like baseball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can't eat a baseball like you can a eat wheel of cheese. You can't eat it at all, really. So I'm back to coding.
                    I am a web developer. No no, I am a programmer, right? Maybe I'm not even a programmer and I simply
                    enjoy arriving at the solution to a problem that made me think. It is a luxury to have interesting problems.
                </p>

                <h4>About this page</h4>
                <p>
                    I am not a graphic designer though I wish I were. That may be why this page looks like a gulag.
                    I like the color blue, and green.
                    I may add some green later. I'm considering it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are on a small EC2 instance in the middle of nowhere. Quite convenient. This website is under
                    dual SVN/git control by Assembla and Github.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It could also be that I am aesthetically challenged and simply <em>like</em> this kind of page design.

                <p>
                    I am a simple web developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied mathematics and economics in school, though have now developed an interest in computer science.
                    It was a careless time. I could figure out how to integrate a function on the imaginary plane, but I still have no idea
                    how this OAuth plugin works.

                    Algorithm 1, logarithmic time search of the local extrema in a unimodal list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a convex polygon whose vertices are represented on a plane and given as a list, finding the extremum of a dimension
                    reduces to the above algorithm with the added initial calculation of finding which direction along the list is
                    increasing. However, that initial calculation is constant and does not violate the logarithmic running time.
