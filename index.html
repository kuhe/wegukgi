                    I think I've achieved a basic understanding of C++. Templates! Segfaults! Move semantics! Rvalue references! 
                    Effective Modern C++ was a great read. Unfortunately I won't be able to apply any 
                    of it anytime soon beyond my personal projects. The book didn't sound dogmatic at all, refreshingly unlike
                    the blog posts that pass for research output in my world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reference collapsing! Most vexing parse! Okay, okay. 
                </p>

                <h5>Baseball is Hard</h5>
                <p>
                    I'm willing to admit that I write JavaScript professionally ... You know who created my <s>job</s> career?
                    C++. And before that C and various assembly and electronics and the rise of civilization and the invention of agriculture.
                    A storied lineage. I took a look at the source code for how to plant corn-- I mean, the PHP interpreter and the V8 compilers, and
                    well, what was it all for?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was probably very fun/interesting in its own right, plus now we can write some really terrible (powerful (terrible (powerful))) code
                    such as eval, and switch types on the fly. What I code is pretty much plain English in comparison to what came before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Baseball remains the same. I recently added batted ball trajectory animation to my baseball distraction project.
                    I used arctangent in real life, and felt a solemn ghost reach out from the before time and hand me my 10th grade
                    trigonometry book. SOHCAHTOA, it chanted repeatedly. As for the differential equations describing air resistance
                    on a batted ball, well... I just estimated some scalar approximations, womp womp. Take a a few swings sometime.
                </p>

                <h5>Wisdom Goes</h5>
                <p>
                    So I reviewed my "computer science", pointers, references, templates, and algorithms. I did it in C#
                    and when that wasn't obtuse enough I did it in (GCC) C++, for a while it was great. Then I had too much to do
                    and set it aside. My respect for the field grows steadily.
                </p>
                <h6>July 15th, 2014</h6>
                <h5>As I once was</h5>
                <p>
                    I studied mathematics in college at an age when I had an urge to be book-smart. The last few years
                    has seen that urge all but die out, as I joined the workforce as a code monkey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel it returning. In practice the code only needs to work correctly, but I have a desire
                    to write it in a way that makes it agile to change, decoupled, elastic, readable, and maintainable.
                    And instructive. And I want to be able to do this quickly and efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus I have somehow gotten it in my head that I must review some core CS, namely the topics of
                    data structures and algorithms.

                <h5>Maker of Websites</h5>
                <p>
                    I made a personal website, because as, ostensibly, a professional <em>web site maker</em>, I
                    really ought to have had one the whole time, I suppose.
                    I got really sidetracked making a baseball game in JavaScript. I like the base ball. I would
                    rate it as one of the top 7 bat based sporting activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can't eat a baseball like you can a eat wheel of cheese. You can't eat it at all, really. So I'm back to coding.
                    I am a web developer. No no, I am a programmer, right? Maybe I'm not even a programmer and I simply
                    enjoy arriving at the solution to a problem that made me think. It is a luxury to have interesting problems.

                    I am not a graphic designer though I wish I were. That may be why this page looks like a gulag.
                    I like the color blue, and green.
                    I may add some green later. I'm considering it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are on a small EC2 instance in the middle of nowhere. It has probably been hacked but this isn't a Wordpress
                    install so they couldn't find where to put the shoe ads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It could also be that I <em>like</em> this kind of page design, or indication of an aggressive laziness.

                <p>
                    I am a simple web page maker in the vein of makers of shoes, a cobbler, or cheese, a ... cheeser. Fromager, if you'll excuse the French.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied numbers and letters in school, though have now developed an interest in computer science.
                    It was a careless time. I could figure out how to integrate a function on the imaginary plane, but not
                    how to relax a little.
