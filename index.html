                <h5>As I once was</h5>
                <p>
                    I studied mathematics in college at an age when I had an urge to be book-smart. The last few years
                    has seen that urge all but die out, as I joined the workforce as a code monkey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel it returning. In practice the code only needs to work correctly, but I have a desire
                    to write it in a way that makes it agile to change, decoupled, elastic, readable, and maintainable.
                    And instructive. And I want to be able to do this quickly and efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus I have somehow gotten it in my head that I must review some core CS, namely the topics of
                    data structures and algorithms.
                </p>

                <h5>Maker of Websites</h5>
                <p>
                    I made a personal website, because as, ostensibly, a professional <em>web site maker</em>, I
                    really ought to have had one the whole time, I suppose.
                    I got really sidetracked making a baseball game in javascript. I like baseball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can't eat a baseball like you can a eat wheel of cheese. You can't eat it at all, really. So I'm back to coding.
                    I am a web developer. No no, I am a programmer, right? Maybe I'm not even a programmer and I simply
                    enjoy arriving at the solution to a problem that made me think. It is a luxury to have interesting problems.
                </p>

            <div class='text-left journal col-lg-6'>
                <h4>About this page</h4>
                <p>
                    I am not a graphic designer though I wish I were. That may be why this page looks like a gulag.
                    I like the color blue, and green.
                    I may add some green later. I'm considering it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are on a small EC2 instance in the middle of nowhere. Quite convenient. This website is under
                    dual SVN/git control by Assembla and Github.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It could also be that I am aesthetically challenged and simply <em>like</em> this kind of page design.

                <p>
                    I am a simple web developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied mathematics and economics in school, though have now developed an interest in computer science.
                    It was a careless time. I could figure out how to integrate a function on the imaginary plane, but I still have no idea
                    how this OAuth plugin works.
