                <p>
                    I made a personal website, because as, ostensibly, a professional <em>web site maker</em>, I
                    really ought to have had one the whole time, I suppose.
                    I got really sidetracked making a baseball game in javascript. I like baseball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can't eat a baseball like you can a eat wheel of cheese. You can't eat it at all, really. So I'm back to coding.
                    I am a web developer. No no, I am a programmer, right? Maybe I'm not even a programmer and I simply
                    enjoy arriving at the solution to a problem that made me think. It is a luxury to have interesting problems.

                <h4>About this page</h4>
                <p>
                    I am not a graphic designer though I wish I were. That may be why this page looks like a gulag. I like the color blue, and green.
                    I may add some green later. I'm considering it
                    heavily, I tell you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are on a small EC2 in the middle of nowhere. Quite convenient. The index is under SVN but the projects are under Git.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It could also be that I am aesthetically challenged and simply <em>like</em> this kind of page design.

                <h4>About the author</h4>
                <p>
                    I name parent scope access variables giraffe and zebra. In my company's repo there are about 1095 calls to the
                    general query class. I offer that simply as a comparison. There are 528 giraffes and 128 zebras. There would be
                    more zebras but you just don't enter two scope levels that much and sometimes I just leave them named _this if I am not the
                    originating author of that code block. If you did have need to enter a third level of scope, and I question when this may arise,
                    the variable name would surely be M for monkey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied mathematics and economics in school. Mathematics is like the server side programming to economics' client side.
                    It was a careless time. I could figure out how to integrate a function on the imaginary plane, but I still have no idea
                    how this OAuth plugin works.
